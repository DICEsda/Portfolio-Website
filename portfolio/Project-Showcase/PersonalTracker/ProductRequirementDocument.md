## 1. Overview

This project aims to develop a **full-stack AI-powered personal dashboard** designed to help users monitor, understand, and improve key aspects of their livesâ€”such as **fitness, finances, mental well-being**, and **daily routines**. All user data will be tracked automatically via external APIs when possible, or manually through the app itself. AI-generated insights will support habit formation and reflection.

Though initially developed for personal use, the solution is designed with future **scalability and public usability** in mind.

## 2. Goals

- Centralize life tracking across fitness, finances, routines, and mindfulness.
- Enable **habit consistency** and reflection via AI-generated insights.
- Provide a simple and intuitive user experience with clean visualizations.
- Establish a robust backend and frontend foundation for **future extensibility**.
- Deliver a **portfolio-ready prototype within 1 week**.
